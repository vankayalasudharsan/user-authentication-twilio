1. Clone this repo.
2. Install dependencies with `npm install`.
3. Change The Database credentials in Dot env file.
4. run migration command with `npx sequelize-cli db:migrate` so database will be migrated.
5. Run the app with `npm start`.

## Postman Collection
- Import the Postman Collection JSON file to your postman for testing.
- setup environment in postman url key value as `http://localhost:3700`.

## Database Design
- Review the database design documents using this file DatabseModel.draw.io open it in draw.io.
